# Oficina-Interface

**This is the interface that complements the API developed in the "Oficina" repository project, in this profile.
It is simple and its main purpose is to be easy to use and intuitive.**

## Screens

**Next, I will present each screen of interface (until now) and I will explain how each one will work in pratice**

### First Screen

This is the login screen. Whenever accessed, the sistem will display this screen and ask the user's credentials.
